#### Additional Scenarios
A complete list of available scenarios can be found in the GTA V scenario metadata files. You can use any valid GTA V scenario name in your configuration. The scenarios listed above are just commonly used examples that work well with guard behaviors.

To use additional scenarios:
1. Find the scenario name from GTA V's scenario metadata.
2. Add it to your Area configuration:
```xml
<SpawnPoint type="ped" scenario="SCENARIO_NAME">
    <Position x="0.0" y="0.0" z="0.0" />
    <Heading>0.0</Heading>
</SpawnPoint>
```

> **Note**: Not all GTA V scenarios will work appropriately with guard behaviors. Test scenarios in-game to ensure they provide the desired behavior.

## Examples

### Example 1: Military Base Guard Post
```xml
<Area name="ArmyGate1" model="army1_guard">
    <SpawnPoint type="ped">
        <Position x="-1614.36" y="2806.01" z="17.73" />
        <Heading>293.30</Heading>
    </SpawnPoint>
    <!-- Additional spawn points -->
</Area>
```

### Example 2: Private Security with Vehicles
```xml
<Area name="SecurityCheckpoint" model="gruppe6_guard">
    <SpawnPoint type="ped" scenario="WORLD_HUMAN_GUARD_STAND">
        <Position x="0.0" y="0.0" z="0.0" />
        <Heading>90.0</Heading>
    </SpawnPoint>
    <SpawnPoint type="vehicle">
        <Position x="5.0" y="0.0" z="0.0" />
        <Heading>90.0</Heading>
    </SpawnPoint>
</Area>
```

### Example 3: Interior Guard Configuration
```xml
<Area name="BuildingSecurity" model="security_guard">
    <SpawnPoint type="ped" scenario="WORLD_HUMAN_GUARD_STAND" interior="true">
        <Position x="100.0" y="100.0" z="30.0" />
        <Heading>180.0</Heading>
    </SpawnPoint>
</Area>
```

## Custom Usage

This mod can be used for a variety of custom setups beyond standard guard patrols, including:
- **Roadblocks**: Set up custom roadblocks with guards and vehicles.
- **Sniper Spots**: Position guards at strategic sniper spots.
- **Checkpoints**: Create security checkpoints with guards and vehicles.
- **Interior Security**: Secure inside buildings with interior spawn points.

> **Important**: Avoid using guards and law enforcement types in the same location as they have conflicting relationships. Modify `relationships.dat` if necessary to adjust behaviors before setting up mixed security types.

## Important Notes

1. **Coordinate System**
   - Use in-game position logging (Press 'L' key) to get accurate coordinates.
   - Heading: 0째 = North, 90째 = East, 180째 = South, 270째 = West.

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Limit spawn points in high-traffic areas.
   - Consider using `interior="true"` for proper indoor spawning.
   - Use scenarios appropriately for more realistic behaviors.

3. **Position Logging**
   - Enable position logging in `Guarding.ini`.
   - Use the 'L' key (configurable) to log coordinates.
   - Logged positions are saved in XML format for easy copying.

4. **Scenario Usage**
   - When no scenario is specified, guards will use default patrol behavior.
   - Some scenarios work better in specific locations (e.g., WORLD_HUMAN_GUARD_STAND for checkpoints).
   - Not all scenarios work with all guard types.

5. **Vehicle Spawns**
   - Ensure adequate space for vehicle spawns.
   - Vehicle types must match those defined in `Guards.xml`.
   - Consider terrain and road access for vehicle spawn points.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have the latest version of GTA V.
2. Install Script Hook V.
3. Copy mod files to the game directory.
4. Configure guard locations in `Areas.xml`.
5. Adjust guard settings in `Guards.xml`.
